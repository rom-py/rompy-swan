            [inrhog] [hsrerr] NAUTICAL|->CARTESIAN [pwtail] [froudmax] [icewind]

    With this optional command the user assigns values to various general parameters.

    Notes
    -----
    The error level `maxerr` is coded as follows:

    * 1: warnings
    * 2: errors (possibly automatically repaired or repairable by SWAN)
    * 3: severe errors

    Default values for `pwtail` depend on formulations of physics:

    * command GEN1: `pwtail = 5`
    * command GEN2: `pwtail = 5`
    * command GEN3 KOMEN: `pwtail = 4`
    * command GEN3 WESTH: `pwtail = 4`
    * command GEN3 JANSSEN: `pwtail = 5`
