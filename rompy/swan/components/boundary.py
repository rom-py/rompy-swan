    `BOUNDNEST2 WAMNEST 'fname' FREE|UNFORMATTED (CRAY|WKSTAT) [xgc] [ygc] [lwdate]`

    With this optional command (not fully tested) a nested SWAN run can be carried out
    with the boundary conditions obtained from a coarse grid WAM run (WAM Cycle 4.5,
    source code as distributed by the Max Planck Institute in Hamburg). The spectral
    frequencies and directions of the coarse grid run do not have to coincide with the
    frequencies and directions used in the nested SWAN run; SWAN will interpolate to
    these frequencies and directions in the nested run (see Section 2.6.3). Note that
    SWAN will accept output of a WAM output location only if the SWAN grid point on the
    nest boundary lies within a rectangle between two consecutive WAM output locations
    with a width equal to 0.1 times the distance between these output locations on
    either side of the line between these WAM output locations. This BOUNDNEST2 command
    is not available for 1D computations. Only boundary conditions generated by WAM
    Cycle 4.5 can be read properly by SWAN. A nested SWAN run may use either Cartesian
    or spherical coordinates. A curvilinear grid may be used in the nested grid but the
    boundaries of this nest should conform to the rectangular course grid nest
    boundaries. WAM output files are unformatted (binary); this usually implies that
    WAM and SWAN have to run on the same computer. For those cases where WAM and SWAN
    run on different types of machines (binary files do not transfer properly), the
    option FREE is available in this command. The distributed version of WAM does not
    support the required free format nesting output; WAM users who modify WAM such that
    it can make formatted output, must modify WAM such that the files made by WAM can
    be read in free format, i.e. with at least a blank or comma between numbers.
